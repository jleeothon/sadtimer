# sadtimer

Timer for software architecture and design class

## Some design patterns

### Singleton

In `lib/counter.js`, there is only a single object that controls the time session variable.

### Strategy

In `client/sadtimer.js`, the code for handling each keystroke may be an example of a strategy (choosing behavior dynamically) switched on the key code and with first-class funcitions.

### Partial function

In `lib/counter.js`, the function set to interval is dynamically generated, but using underscore.js' `_.partial` function.

### Factory

In `client/clock.js`, each "hand" of the clock is generated by a function that abstracts the underlying function.

## Other patterns

## Publish-Subscribe

Using Meteor's publish-subscrib system, servers publish collections (countdown timers, stopwatch timers, laps), and clients subscribe to these.

## Remote procedure call

`Meteor.call` asynchronously invokes methods on the server from the client, as part of DDP, Distributed Data Protocol.
